I pursue my Ph.D. in the [Data Analytics and Machine Learning (DAML)](https://www.in.tum.de/daml/startseite/) group at the Technical University of Munich (TUM), where I am supervised by [Stephan Günnemann](https://www.in.tum.de/daml/team/guennemann/).

My research focuses on **efficient** machine learning methods for **uncertainty estimation** for different **input** and **output types**. In particular, I am interested in defining *desiderata*, *models* and *evaluation* methods for practical uncertainty estimation in real-world applications.

Other research interests include *structure learning* (e.g. hierarchy, DAGs), *causal Inference* and *efficient machine learning*.
